## Ход работы
### Задание 1: Basic Building Blocks
  |===                                                            | 0%

| In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R
| programming language.

...

  |==                                                             |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic
| related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open
| a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web
| browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search
| often yields the answer you're looking for.

...

  |===                                                            |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
| 5 + 7 and press Enter.

```{r}
5+7
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |=====                                                          |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a
| programming language and often the reason we use a programming
| language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or
| avoid unnecessary repetition.

...

  |=======                                                        |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second
| calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can
| just create a new variable that stores the result.

...

  |========                                                       |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the
| assignment operator, which is just a 'less than' symbol followed by a
| 'minus' sign. It looks like this: <-

...

  |==========                                                     |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the
| value on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left
| side of the arrow.

...

  |============                                                   |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x
| <- 5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

```{r}
 x<-5+7
```
 
| You got it!

  |=============                                                  |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When
| you use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see
| the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result
| for something else later on.

...

  |===============                                                |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter.
| Try it now.

```{r}
 x
```

| That's a job well done!

  |=================                                              |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

```{r}
 y<-x-3
```

| You're the best!

  |==================                                             |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

```{r}
y
```

| Excellent work!

  |====================                                           |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any
| object that contains data is called a data structure and numeric
| vectors are the simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a
| single number is considered a vector of length one.

...

  |======================                                         |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which
| stands for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing
| the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and
| store the result in a variable called z.

```{r}
z<-c(1.1,9,3.14)
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |=======================                                        |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access
| R's built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want
| more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses
| that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

```{r}
?c
```

| Excellent work!

  |=========================                                      |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas
| separating the values in the output.

```{r}
z
```

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |===========================                                    |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that
| contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector
| to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

```{r}
c(z,555,z)
```


| That's a job well done!

  |============================                                   |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the
| following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.

```{r}
z*2+100
```

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==============================                                 |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it
| added 100 to each element to get the result you see above.

...

  |================================                               |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where
| x^2 means 'x squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt()
| function and to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.

...

  |=================================                              |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called
| my_sqrt.

```{r}
my_sqrt<-sqrt(z-1)
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===================================                            |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think
| it contains?

1: a vector of length 3
2: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)

Выбор:1

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |====================================                           |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.
```{r}
my_sqrt
```

| Excellent work!

  |======================================                         |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z,
| then took the square root of each element. This leaves you with a
| vector of the same length as the original vector z.

...

  |========================================                       |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z
| divided by my_sqrt.

```{r}
my_div<-z/my_sqrt
```

| All that practice is paying off!

  |=========================================                      |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: my_div is undefined
3: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...

Выбор:3

| You are really on a roll!

  |===========================================                    |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

```{r}
my_div
```

| You are really on a roll!

  |=============================================                  |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the
| specified arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.)
| element-by-element. If the vectors are of different lengths, R
| 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length as the
| longer vector.

...

  |==============================================                 |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of
| length 3, but technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

...

  |================================================               |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and
| the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to
| compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) +
| c(100, 100, 100).

...

  |==================================================             |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try
| adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result
| in a new variable.

```{r}
c(1,2,3,4) + c(0,10)
```

| You are really on a roll!

  |===================================================            |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the
| length of the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling'
| method, but will throw a warning to let you know something fishy might
| be going on.

...

  |=====================================================          |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

```{r}
c(1,2,3,4)+c(0,10,100)
```

Предупреждение:
В c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  длина большего объекта не является произведением длины меньшего объекта

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=======================================================        |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of
| time-saving tricks.

...

  |========================================================       |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that
| you made a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You
| could either re-type the expression, or...

...

  |==========================================================     |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through
| previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you
| get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit
| Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the corrected
| command.

```{r}
z*2+1000
```

| You are amazing!

  |============================================================   |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable
| that you created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named
| it my_div or myDiv. You could try both and see what works, or...

...

  |=============================================================  |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the
| Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will
| provide a list of variables that you've created that begin with 'my'.
| This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have
| many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion
| doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

```{r}
my_div
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===============================================================| 100%

```{r}
dir()
```

### Задание 2: Workspace and Files

Выбор:2

  |                                                               |   0%

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R
| and begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the
| file system of your machine.

...

  |==                                                             |   3%
| Because different operating systems have different conventions with
| regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may
| vary across machines.

...

  |===                                                            |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common
| set of commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will
| work across different kinds of computers.

...

  |=====                                                          |   8%
| Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special
| functions work!

...

  |======                                                         |  10%
| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current
| working directory using getwd().

```{r}
getwd()
```

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |========                                                       |  13%
| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

```{r}
ls()
```      

| That's correct!

  |==========                                                     |  15%
| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or
| on a Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based on an
| operating system called Unix. It's always a good idea to learn more
| about Unix!

...

  |===========                                                    |  18%
| Assign 9 to x using x <- 9.

```{r}
x<-9
```

| That's a job well done!

  |=============                                                  |  21%
| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

```{r}
ls()
```     

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |===============                                                |  23%
| List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or
| dir().

```{r}
dir()
```

| All that practice is paying off!

  |================                                               |  26%
| As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page
| for each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the
| command ?list.files.

```{r}
?list.files
```

| That's correct!

  |==================                                             |  28%
| One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also
| section. Read that section for list.files. Some of these functions may
| be used in later portions of this lesson.

...

  |===================                                            |  31%
| Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to
| see what arguments a function can take.

...

  |=====================                                          |  33%
| Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

```{r}
args(list.files)
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |=======================                                        |  36%
| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called
| "old.dir".

```{r}
old.dir<-getwd()
```

| That's correct!

  |========================                                       |  38%
| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the
| place that we started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have the
| useful property that they return the answer to the question as a
| result of the function.

...

  |==========================                                     |  41%
| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working
| directory called "testdir".

```{r}
dir.create("testdir")
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===========================                                    |  44%
| We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after
| we are done. This is the R analog to "Take only pictures, leave only
| footprints."

...

  |=============================                                  |  46%
| Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command.

```{r}
setwd("testdir")
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============================                                |  49%
| In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace
| sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you are
| working on. In fact, organizing your work in R packages using RStudio
| is an excellent option. Check out RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/

...

  |================================                               |  51%
| Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using the
| file.create() function.

```{r}
file.create("mytest.R")
```

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==================================                             |  54%
| This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let's
| check this by listing all the files in the current directory.

```{r}
list.files()
```

| You got it right!

  |====================================                           |  56%
| Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the
| file.exists() function.

```{r}
file.exists("mytest.R")
```

| That's a job well done!

  |=====================================                          |  59%
| These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if
| you are running a program that loops through a series of files and
| does some processing on each one, you will want to check to see that
| each exists before you try to process it.

...

  |=======================================                        |  62%
| Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using file.info().

```{r}
file.info("mytest.R")
```

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |========================================                       |  64%
| You can use the $ operator --- e.g., file.info("mytest.R")$mode --- to
| grab specific items.

...

  |==========================================                     |  67%
| Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using
| file.rename().

```{r}
file.rename("mytest.R","mytest2.R")
```

| All that practice is paying off!

  |============================================                   |  69%
| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of
| tasks, but having the ability to manipulate files programatically is
| useful. You might now try to delete mytest.R using
| file.remove('mytest.R'), but that won't work since mytest.R no longer
| exists. You have already renamed it.

...

  |=============================================                  |  72%
| Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy().

```{r}
file.copy("mytest2.R","mytest3.R")
```

| Excellent work!

  |===============================================                |  74%
| You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem
| very interesting. But what if you were working with dozens, or
| millions, of individual files? In that case, being able to
| programatically act on many files would be absolutely necessary. Don't
| forget that you can, temporarily, leave the lesson by typing play()
| and then return by typing nxt().

...

  |================================================               |  77%
| Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using
| file.path().

```{r}
file.path("mytest3.R")
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |==================================================             |  79%
| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are
| independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass
| 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to file.path to make a
| platform-independent pathname.

```{r}
file.path('folder1','folder2')
```

| You're the best!

  |====================================================           |  82%
| Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering
| ?dir.create . Notice the 'recursive' argument. In order to create
| nested directories, 'recursive' must be set to TRUE.

```{r}
?dir.create

| Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2"
| and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command by
| using dir.create() and file.path().

```{r}
dir.create(file.path('testdir2','testdir3'),recursive = TRUE)
```

| All that practice is paying off!

  |=======================================================        |  87%
| Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that
| we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal
| working directory at the start of these questions.)

```{r}

| You are really on a roll!

  |=========================================================      |  90%
| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began
| an analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often
| used within functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you
| started with, mess around a bunch, and then set them back to the
| original values at the end. This isn't the same as what we have done
| here, but it seems similar enough to mention.

### Задание 3: Sequences of Numbers

Выбор:3

  |                                                               |   0%

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R.

...

  |===                                                            |   4%
| The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the
| `:` operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.

```{r}
1:20
```

| Excellent job!

  |=====                                                          |   9%
| That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could
| also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try
| pi:10.

```{r}
pi:10
```

| You are really on a roll!

  |========                                                       |  13%
| The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and
| increasing in increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is never reached,
| since the next number in our sequence would be greater than 10.

...

  |===========                                                    |  17%
| What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

```{r}
15:1
```

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==============                                                 |  22%
| It counted backwards in increments of 1! It's unlikely we'd want this
| behavior, but nonetheless it's good to know how it could happen.

...

  |================                                               |  26%
| Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you
| can access its documentation with a question mark followed by the
| function name: ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an
| operator like the colon used above, you must enclose the symbol in
| backticks like this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The backtick (`) key is generally
| located in the top left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If
| you don't have a backtick key, you can use regular quotes.)

...

  |===================                                            |  30%
| Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

```{r}
?':'
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |======================                                         |  35%
| Often, we'll desire more control over a sequence we're creating than
| what the `:` operator gives us. The seq() function serves this
| purpose.

...

  |=========================                                      |  39%
| The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:`
| operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.

```{r} 
seq(1,20)
```

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===========================                                    |  43%
| This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let's say that instead
| we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5.
| seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.

```{r}
seq(0,10, by=0.5)
```

| That's a job well done!

  |==============================                                 |  48%
| Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a
| sequence of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does
| the trick. Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable
| called my_seq.

```{r}
my_seq<-seq(5,10,length=30)
```

| Nice work!

  |=================================                              |  52%
| To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length()
| function. Try it now.

```{r}
length(my_seq)
```

| Excellent work!

  |====================================                           |  57%
| Let's pretend we don't know the length of my_seq, but we want to
| generate a sequence of integers from 1 to N, where N represents the
| length of the my_seq vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1,
| 2, 3, ...) that is the same length as my_seq.

...

  |======================================                         |  61%
| There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine
| the `:` operator and the length() function like this:
| 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.

```{r}
1:length(my_seq)
```

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=========================================                      |  65%
| Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

```{r}
seq(along.with=my_seq)
```

| Excellent job!

  |============================================                   |  70%
| However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate
| built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type
| seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.

```{r}
seq_along(my_seq)
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============================================                |  74%
| There are often several approaches to solving the same problem,
| particularly in R. Simple approaches that involve less typing are
| generally best. It's also important for your code to be readable, so
| that you and others can figure out what's going on without too much
| hassle.

...

  |=================================================              |  78%
| If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that
| function is highly optimized for that purpose and is your best option.
| As you become a more advanced R programmer, you'll design your own
| functions to perform tasks when there are no better options. We'll
| explore writing your own functions in future lessons.

...

  |====================================================           |  83%
| One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(),
| which stands for 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

...

  |=======================================================        |  87%
| If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we
| can use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

```{r} 
rep(0,times=40)
```

| You are really on a roll!

  |==========================================================     |  91%
| If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector
| (0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

```{r}
rep(c(0,1,2),times=10)
```

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |============================================================   |  96%
| Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2)
| over and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10
| ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try
| rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).

```{r}
rep(c(0,1,2),each=10)
```

| Keep up the great work!

### Задание 4: Vectors

| The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.

...

  |==                                                             |   3%
| Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An
| atomic vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may
| contain multiple data types. We'll explore atomic vectors further
| before we get to lists.

...

  |===                                                            |   5%
| In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are
| one type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic vectors include
| logical, character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a
| closer look at logical and character vectors.

...

  |=====                                                          |   8%
| Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not
| available'). These values are generated as the result of logical
| 'conditions'. Let's experiment with some simple conditions.

...

  |=======                                                        |  11%
| First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5,
| 55, -10, and 6.

```{r}
num_vect <-c(0.5,55,-10,6)
```

| That's a job well done!

  |========                                                       |  13%
| Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1,
| which is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.

```{r}
tf<-num_vect<1
```

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==========                                                     |  16%
| What do you think tf will look like?

1: a single logical value
2: a vector of 4 logical values

Выбор:2

| You are quite good my friend!

  |============                                                   |  18%
| Print the contents of tf now.

```{r}
tf
```

| That's correct!

  |=============                                                  |  21%
| The statement num_vect < 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each
| corresponding element of our numeric vector num_vect satisfies this
| condition.

...

  |===============                                                |  24%
| The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and
| therefore the statement 0.5 < 1 is TRUE. The second element of
| num_vect is 55, which is greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is
| FALSE. The same logic applies for the third and fourth elements.

...

  |=================                                              |  26%
| Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to
| a new variable.

```{r}
num_vect>=6
```

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |==================                                             |  29%
| This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect
| is greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or
| equal to 6, the second and fourth elements of the result are TRUE and
| the first and third elements are FALSE.

...

  |====================                                           |  32%
| The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical
| operators'. Other logical operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact
| equality, and `!=` for inequality.

...

  |======================                                         |  34%
| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at
| least one is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether
| they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection').
| Lastly, !A is the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice
| versa.

...

  |=======================                                        |  37%
| It's a good idea to spend some time playing around with various
| combinations of these logical operators until you get comfortable with
| their use. We'll do a few examples here to get you started.

...

  |=========================                                      |  39%
| Try your best to predict the result of each of the following
| statements. You can use pencil and paper to work them out if it's

| Don't worry if you found these to be tricky. They're supposed to be.
| Working with logical statements in R takes practice, but your efforts
| will be rewarded in future lessons (e.g. subsetting and control
| structures).

...

  |=================================                              |  53%
| Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to
| distinguish character objects, as in the following example.

...

  |===================================                            |  55%
| Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My",
| "name", "is". Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double
| quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector
| in a variable called my_char.

```{r}
my_char <- c("My","name","is")
```

| That's correct!

  |====================================                           |  58%
| Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

```{r}
my_char
```

| You are amazing!

  |======================================                         |  61%
| Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Lets say we
| want to join the elements of my_char together into one continuous
| character string (i.e. a character vector of length 1). We can do this
| using the paste() function.


  |========================================                       |  63%
| Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure theres a space
| between the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. Youll see why
| in a second.

 
```{r}
paste(my_char,collapse=" ")
```


| Excellent work!

  |=========================================                      |  66%
| The `collapse` argument to the paste() function tells R that when we
| join together the elements of the my_char character vector, we'd like
| to separate them with single spaces.

...

  |===========================================                    |  68%
| It seems that we're missing something.... Ah, yes! Your name!

...

  |=============================================                  |  71%
| To add (or 'concatenate') your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
| function like this: c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name in
| double quotes where I've put "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the
| result in a new variable called my_name.

```{r}
my_name <- c(my_char,"nootune")
```

| That's a job well done!

  |==============================================                 |  74%
| Take a look at the contents of my_name.

```{r}
my_name
```

| You got it!

  |================================================               |  76%
| Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name
| together into a single character string. Don't forget to say collapse
| = " "!

```{r}
paste(my_name,collapse = " ")
```

| You got it!

  |==================================================             |  79%
| In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements
| of a single character vector. paste() can also be used to join the
| elements of multiple character vectors.

...

  |===================================================            |  82%
| In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each
| of length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep =
| " "), where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the
| joined elements with a single space.

```{r}
paste("Hello","world!",sep=" ")
```

| Great job!

  |=====================================================          |  84%
| For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each
| of length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the
| character vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep = "" to leave no
| space between the joined elements.

```{r}
paste(1:3,c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |=======================================================        |  87%
| What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length?
| (Hint: we talked about this in a previous lesson.)

...

  |========================================================       |  89%
| Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is
| a predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26
| letters in the English alphabet.

```{r}
paste(LETTERS,1:4,sep="-")
```

| Keep up the great work!

  |==========================================================     |  92%
| Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector
| 1:4, R simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches the length of
| LETTERS.

...

  |============================================================   |  95%
| Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets 'coerced' into a
| character vector by the paste() function.

...

  |=============================================================  |  97%
| We'll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is
| that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the output above are no longer
| numbers to R, but rather characters "1", "2", "3", and "4".

### Задание 4: Missing Values

Выбор:5

  |                                                               |   0%

| Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis.
| Often, missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be
| carefully studied to see if there's an underlying pattern or cause for
| their missingness.


  |===                                                            |   5%
| In R, NA is used to represent any value that is 'not available' or
| 'missing' (in the statistical sense). In this lesson, we'll explore
| missing values further.

...

  |======                                                         |  10%
| Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To
| illustrate, let's create a vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign it to a
| variable x.

```{r}
c(44,NA,5,NA)
```

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Assign the vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) to a variable x. The NA must
| uppercase.

```{r}
x<-c(44,NA,5,NA)
```
| You are really on a roll!

  |=========                                                      |  15%
| Now, let's multiply x by 3.

```{r}
x*3
```

| Nice work!

  |=============                                                  |  20%
| Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with
| the NA values in x are also NA.

...

  |================                                               |  25%
| To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector
| containing 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution with y <-
| rnorm(1000).

```{r}
y<-rnorm(1000)
```

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |===================                                            |  30%
| Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA,
| 1000).

```{r}
z<-rep(NA,1000)
```

| You are quite good my friend!

  |======================                                         |  35%
| Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values
| (combining y and z) such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up
| with or what positions they'll occupy in our final vector -- my_data
| <- sample(c(y, z), 100).

```{r}
my_data<-sample(c(y,z),100)
```

| That's a job well done!

  |=========================                                      |  40%
| Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data.
| The is.na() function tells us whether each element of a vector is NA.
| Call is.na() on my_data and assign the result to my_na.

```{r}
my_na<-is.na(my_data)
```

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |============================                                   |  45%
| Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.

```{r}
my_na
```

| You are amazing!

  |================================                               |  50%
| Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of
| my_data is NA. Likewise, everywhere you see a FALSE, you know the
| corresponding element of my_data is one of our random draws from the
| standard normal distribution.

...

  |===================================                            |  55%
| In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the
| `==` operator as a method of testing for equality between two objects.
| So, you might think the expression my_data == NA yields the same
| results as is.na(). Give it a try.

```{r}
my_data==NA
```

| You are really on a roll!

  |======================================                         |  60%
| The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a
| value, but just a placeholder for a quantity that is not available.
| Therefore the logical expression is incomplete and R has no choice but
| to return a vector of the same length as my_data that contains all
| NAs.

...

  |=========================================                      |  65%
| Don't worry if that's a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be
| cautious when using logical expressions anytime NAs might creep in,
| since a single NA value can derail the entire thing.

...

  |============================================                   |  70%
| So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that
| has a TRUE for every NA and FALSE for every numeric value, we can
| compute the total number of NAs in our data.

...

  |===============================================                |  75%
| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents
| TRUE as the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take
| the sum of a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of
| TRUEs.

...

  |==================================================             |  80%
| Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count
| the total number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total number of NAs
| in my_data. Don't assign the result to a new variable.

```{r}
sum(my_na)
```

| That's a job well done!

  |======================================================         |  85%
| Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let's take a look at the data to convince
| ourselves that everything 'adds up'. Print my_data to the console.

```{r} 
my_data
```


| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=========================================================      |  90%
| Now that we've got NAs down pat, let's look at a second type of
| missing value -- NaN, which stands for 'not a number'. To generate
| NaN, try dividing (using a forward slash) 0 by 0 now.

```{r}
0/0
```

| That's a job well done!

  |============================================================   |  95%
| Let's do one more, just for fun. In R, Inf stands for infinity. What
| happens if you subtract Inf from Inf?

```{r}
Inf-Inf
```

| You are really on a roll!
